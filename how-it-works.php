  <h1>How Does Snack Trax Food Tracking System Work?"</h1>
  <p> When members first sign-up to Snack Trax, they are presented with the option to create their first Snack Trax food tracking form. This food tracking form allows for Snack Trax members to choose the type of food they will be tracking for their beloved family member, the time this food should be consumed, and the actual amount of this food that should be consumed. Once our Snack Trax member defines these categories, they will be able to submit this food tracking form and rely on Snack Trax to remember these specific feeding time rituals.</p>
